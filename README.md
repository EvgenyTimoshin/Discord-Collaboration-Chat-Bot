# Discord-Collaboration-Chat-Bot
This version of the chat bot won our team : Evgeny Timoshin(me), Zan Smirnov and Abdul Aziz the 2017 Intervarsity Hackaton at WorkDay, orgranised by the Dublin Institue of Technology Computer Science Society.

This chat bow was codded in Python using the Discord and GitHub api. The current version of the bot represents a bot completed in a hackation (coding competition) in 5 hours.
This bot was designed to help a team of developers collaborate on a project. This bot automates alot of task that would take time and distract you from actually developping
your application. Automatically creates a github repo for a project the team is working on. Will assign roles to individuals. Can assign reminders (as a to do list) for individuals or the group as a whole.
Creates automatic GitHubGist links for quick code sharing. Work in Progress : Will be updated in the future for more functionality
